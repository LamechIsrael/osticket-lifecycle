<p>
Here, I created a ticket. It was a simple thing for demonstration purposes. I also used the user "Karen" who was created in the post-installation portion.

</p>
<p>
I logged in as Joe, to view and work the ticket. This, actually, is when I learned he didn't have the permissions necessary. So, I changed his access to allow him to work the ticket. I had him set the SLA to "Sev-A." Also, I had him assign the ticket to the "Online Banking" team. Lastly, I had him create comments to explain why he did these things.
</p>

<p>
  After that, I logged on as Jane, so I could see the results. As the picture here shows, Jane can see John's actions and comments. Jane is also part of the online banking team.

</p>
<p>
The ticket is marked "overdue" because I took a nap while making these pictures. At the SLA level "Sev-A" this should have been done within an hour. And if a system was truly down, it would have been dealt with promptly. In any case, I had Jane send a comment regarding what steps would be taken to resolve the issue. For I know that it is not enough just to work on a ticket, but logs must be made so everyone knows what is going on. If I begin working on a ticket, I should say so. Especially, as if two people began working on a single ticket because neither knew the other was doing so, it would be a waste of resources. Also, the actions of one could affect the other's progress. Therefore, proper communication is essential.

</p>
<p>
Afterward, I left a comment simulating that the ticket was resolved. And then, I closed the ticket.
</p>

</p>
<p>
Then, logging into the admin account, I reviewed the closed ticket. This is the entirety of the ticket lifecycle. Therefore, I know how to create, assign, comment on, and complete a ticket in osTicket. I also know how to make internal comments that the users cannot see but the agents can. But I did not display that here.
